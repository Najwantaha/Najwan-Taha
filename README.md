With expertise in SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and data analysis, I am adept at leveraging these tools to extract, analyze, and visualize data to support business performance optimization.

My academic foundation includes a Masterâ€™s degree in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, where I honed my analytical and problem-solving abilities, and recently, I completed a Business Intelligence Analysis program at Tripleten Coding Bootcamp, equipping me with cutting-edge skills in data analytics and business intelligence tools.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in both technical and cross-functional roles, including as a Scheduling Engineer at Schindler Group. There, I developed project schedules, performed detailed data analysis, and worked with teams to optimize resource allocationâ€”skills I am eager to apply to data analysis and BI-focused roles. My experience in project management further refined my ability to manage complex tasks while maintaining focus on delivering data-driven solutions that improve outcomes.

Iâ€™m now seeking a Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst position where I can leverage my strong technical expertise, analytical skills, and problem-solving mindset to contribute to data-driven decision-making and business growth.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://1drv.ms/w/c/d418d41a04e73b19/ETldOH_nm0RDnrq0-cGbCRgBXnP1Qycf5aOqX5zkJsOoIw?e=QhX9Xd ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
